            Let's write our first compute grid application   which will count the number of 
            non-white-space characters in a sentence. As an example, we will take a sentence, 
            split it into multiple words, and have every compute job 
            count number of characters in each word. In the end,
            we simply add up results received from individual jobs 
            to get our total count.
